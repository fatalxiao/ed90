\usage{
k2targ(k, lowTarget = FALSE)

ktargOptions(target, tolerance = 0.1, maxk = 20)

g2targ(cohort, lower, upper)

gtargOptions(target, minsize = 2, maxsize = 6, tolerance = 0.1)

bcoin(target, fraction = FALSE, nameplate = FALSE, tolerance = 0.02)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{the number of consecutive identical responses required for dose transitions (k-in-a-row functions only).}

\item{lowTarget}{logical, \code{k2targ()} only: is the design targeting below-median percentiles, with \eqn{k} repeated negative responses needed to level up and only one to level down - or vice versa? Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{target}{the desired target response rate (as a fraction in \eqn{(0,1)}), where relevant.}

\item{tolerance}{\itemize{
\item For \verb{ktargOptions(), gtargOptions()}: the half-width of the interval around \code{target} in which to search for design options. Default 0.1.
\item For \code{bcoin()}: the half-width of the interval around 0.5 in which the function recommends to simply use classical UD without a coin, as well as the approximate amount of rounding to the returned coin probability (whether in decimal on rational terms). Default 0.02, and hard-coded to be no less than 0.0001.
}}

\item{maxk}{\code{ktargOptions()} only: the maximum value of \eqn{k} to consider.}

\item{cohort, lower, upper}{\code{g2targ()} only: the cohort (group) size, how many positive responses are allowed for a move upward, and how many are required for a move downward, respectively. For example \verb{cohort=3, lower=0, upper=2} evaluates groups of 3 observations at a time, moves up if none are positive, down if \eqn{>=2} are positive, and repeats the same dose with 1 positive.}

\item{minsize, maxsize}{\code{gtargOptions()} only: the minimum and maximum cohort size to consider. \code{minsize} has to be at least 2 (cohort size 1 is equivalent to classical UD).}

\item{fraction}{\code{bcoin()} only: whether to report the coin probability as a rational rather than decimal fraction. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{nameplate}{\code{bcoin()} only: in case \code{fraction = TRUE}, whether to return the "exact" rational probability, or allow some nudging of the resulting balance point towards the median. Default \code{FALSE}, and moot when \code{fraction = FALSE}.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \verb{k2targ(), g2targ()}: the official balance point given the user-provided design parameters.
\item \verb{ktargOptions(), gtargOptions()}: a \code{data.frame} with design parameters and official balance point, for all options that meet user-provided constraints. A printed string provides dose transition rule guidance.
\item \verb{bcoin():} a printed string that informs user of the biased-coin design rules, including the 'coin' probability in its user-chosen format (decimal or fraction). In case the user-desired target is 0.5 or very close to it, the string will inform user that they are better off just using classical UDD without a coin.

\details{
This suite of utilities helps users
\itemize{
\item Figure out the approximate target response-rate (a.k.a. the \emph{balance point}), given design parameters;
\item Suggest potential design parameters, given user's desired target response-rate and other constraints.
}

Up-and-down designs (UDDs) generate random walks over dose space, with most dose-allocations usually taking place near the design's de-facto target percentile, called the \strong{"balance point"} by some theorists to distinguish it from the user-designated target in case they differ (Oron and Hoff 2009, Oron et al. 2022).

Most k-in-a-row and group UDD parameter combinations yield balance points that are irrational percentiles of the dose-response function, and therefore are unappealing as official experimental targets.

However, since the UD dose distribution has some width, and since even the balance point itself is only a close approximation for the actual average of allocated doses, the user's target \strong{does not have to be identical to the balance point.} It only needs to be \emph{"close enough"}.

The \code{k2targ()} and \code{g2targ()} utilities are intended for users who already have a specific k-in-a-row or group design in mind, and only want to verify its balance point. The complementary utilities \verb{ktargOptions(), gtargOptions()} provide a broader survey of design-parameter options within user-specified constraints, given a desired target.

Lastly, \code{bcoin()} returns the biased-coin probabilities given the user's designated target. In contrast to the two other UDDs described above, the biased-coin design can target any percentile with a precisely matched balance point. That said, k-in-a-row and group UDDs offer some advantages over biased-coin in terms of properties and operational simplicity.

\code{bcoin()} can return the probability as a decimal (default) or approximate rational fraction. In the latter case, if \code{nameplate} is set to \code{TRUE}, you will get the exact \emph{"nameplate"} coin probability \eqn{\Gamma/(1 - \Gamma)}, with \eqn{\Gamma} being the target percentile between 0 and 1. However, the default \code{nameplate = FALSE} might nudge the coin to yield a balance point somewhat closer to the median. This choice is based upon the theoretical finding that the biased-coin design does tend to concentrate doses a bit further away from the median than the balance point would suggest (Oron and Hoff, 2009). See more information in \code{bcoin()}'s argument descriptions.
