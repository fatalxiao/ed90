#' Van Elstraete, AC et al. The Median Effective Dose of Preemptive Gabapentin 
#'      on Postoperative Morphine Consumption After Posterior Lumbar Spinal Fusion. 
#'      *Anesthesia & Analgesia* 2008, 106: 305-308.

# It was a classical median-finding up-and-down study.

# doses <- c(4:7, 6:13, 12:19, 18:21, 20, 19:23, 22, 21:23, 22:19, 20:23,

#' ### Estimates

#' Let us actually see the numbers of those Centered-Isotonic-Regression (CIR) estimates!
#' Note that our default confidence-interval is 90\%. Change it via the 'conf' argument.

udest(doses, responses, target = 0.9)
#' Compare with the article: 21.7 mg/kg (95\% CI 19.9â€“23.5). 
#' They cite a little-known 1991 article by Dixon as the method source.
#' However, in their author rejoinder they claim to have used the Dixon-Mood estimate.
